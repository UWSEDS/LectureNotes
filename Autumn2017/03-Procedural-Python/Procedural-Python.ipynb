    "The goal today is to take some of the ideas we developed last week, and do a couple things to make our lives easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define standalone functions which accomplish tasks that we would like to do repeatedly\n",
    "- Put these functions in a place where we can easily use them without copy-pasting repeatedly\n",
    "- Think about how to make our analysis reproducible – both for the sake of our future selves, and for the sake of anyone who wants to replicate and/or build on our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, we are going to work together to do the following tasks:"
