## IO Challenges
Reading comma separated values (csv) and tab separated values (tsv) files is easy, right?  Well, not always.  Today we have two challenges based on real world problems doing something seemingly simple: reading a tsv.

### Challenge 1
* Read the file `read_csv_test1.tsv` into a pandas data frame.  You will probably want to do this with `read_csv`.  One problem you will likely have is that the first column doesn't doesn't read properly.  Next, you will probably find that the columns don't line up with the headers.  We also don't have an index column so the rows need to have numerical indexes assigned.  You have 10 minutes to solve the problem.  Use docs, stack overflow, etc.  Start by looking at the file.
* Read the file `read_csv_test2.tsv` into a pandas data frame.  You will probably want to do this with `read_csv`.  One problem you will likely have is that the file doesn't read properly or that it throws an exception. As with the other file, e also don't have an index column so the rows need to have numerical indexes assigned.  You have 10 minutes to solve the problem.  Use docs, stack overflow, etc.  Start by looking at the file.
