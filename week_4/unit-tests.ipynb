    "## Overview and Principles\n",
    "Testing is the process by which you exercise your code to determine if it performs as expected. The code you are testing is referred to as the **code under test**. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to writing tests.\n",
    "1. invoking the code under test so that it is exercised in a particular way;\n",
    "1. evaluating the results of executing code under test to determine if it behaved as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of tests performed are referred to as the **test cases**. The fraction of the code under test that is executed as a result of running the test cases is referred to as **test coverage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For dynamical languages such as Python, it's extremely important to have a high test coverage. In fact, you should try to get 100% coverage. This is because little checking is done when the source code is read by the Python interpreter. For example, the code under test might contain a line that has a function that is undefined. This would not be detected until that line of code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test cases can be of several types. Below are listed some common classifications of test cases.\n",
    "- *Smoke test*. This is an invocation of the code under test to see if there is an unexpected exception. It's useful as a starting point, but this doesn't tell you anything about the correctness of the results of a computation.\n",
    "- *One-shot test*. In this case, you call the code under test with arguments for which you know the expected result.\n",
    "- *Edge test*. The code under test is invoked with arguments that should cause an exception, and you evaluate if the expected exception occurrs.\n",
    "- *Pattern test* - Based on your knowledge of the *calculation* (not implementation) of the code under test, you construct a suite of test cases for which the results are known or there are known patterns in these results that are used to evaluate the results returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another principle of testing is to limit what is done in a single test case. Generally, a test case should focus on one use of one function. Sometimes, this is a challenge since the function being tested may call other functions that you are testing. This means that bugs in the called functions may cause failures in the tests of the calling functions. Often, you sort this out by knowing the structure of the code and focusing first on failures in lower level tests. In other situations, you may use more advanced techniques called *mocking*. A discussion of mocking is beyond the scope of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A best practice is to develop your tests while you are developing your code. Indeed, one school of thought in software engineering, called **test-driven development**, advocates that you write the tests *before* you implement the code under test so that the test cases become a kind of specification for what the code under test should do."
